Some very simple examples of how to create functions, and how to combine them.

FunctionExample.scala
---------------------
Basic example that shows how functions can be created in Scala: either using def, as  function literal (with val) or as an object/class that extends the FunctionX type.

How to run:

scalac FunctionExample.scala
scala FunctionExample

CombinableFunctions.scala
-------------------------
Additional example that shows how functions can be combined with each other to create more powerful functions.

How to run:

scalac CombinableFunctions.scala
scala CombinableFunctions

PartialFunctions.scala
----------------------
Builds on the previous examples to create a new example of partial functions (functions that are only defined for a subset of a domain), and how different partial functions can be combined into a larger function that is used to respond to HTTP requests.

How to run:

scalac PartialFunctions.scala
scala PartialFunctions
